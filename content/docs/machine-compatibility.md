## Machine Compatibility
<span class='fab'>p5.fab</span> is intended to be used with physical machines! In general, it should work with any machine running <a href=https://marlinfw.org>Marlin firmware</a>. This is the firmware that many companies (e.g. Creality, Prusa, Ultimaker) use, as well as various custom/open-source machines. For more background on machine firmwares, check out the <a href="../resources/guides/dfab-intro">digital fabrication intro</a>. We've tested <span class='fab'>p5.fab</span> on the following machines:

| Machine | Info |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Creality Ender3 | 3D Printer |
| Prusa i3-mk3 | 3D Printer |
| FLSUN Q9 | Delta 3D Printer |
| Potterbot 9 | Ceramic 3D Printer |
| Jubilee | Toolchanging Machine |

While most of these are 3D printers, we are working on extending control to Plotters (like the AxiDraw) and CNC machines (like the Othermill). Stay tuned!
